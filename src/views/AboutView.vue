            text="Blockbuster began in 1985 as a video rental store in Dallas, quickly expanding thanks to its wide movie selection and bright, clean stores. By the 1990s, it had become a global giant with thousands of locations, dominating home entertainment. In 2000, it famously declined a chance to buy Netflix for $50 million, underestimating the rise of digital streaming. As online platforms grew and late fees turned customers away, Blockbuster struggled to adapt. Despite a brief push into streaming and a partnership with Enron, its debt and slow innovation led to bankruptcy in 2010. Most stores closed, and today, only one remains as a nostalgic landmark in Bend, Oregon."
